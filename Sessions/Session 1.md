## Story
We arrive in a town called [[Goldmarsh]].
According to [[Crethus Pine]], the Barkeeper from the tavern in [[Goldmarsh]], the [[Gold Statue]] in the centre of town was here before the town was built.
[[Crethus Pine]] says the town is cursed.
A [[Crazy Lady]] thinks [[Crethus Pine]] and others are Monsters.
After leaving the tavern, we then proceeded to get overly fixated on the [[Gold Statue]], damaging it in the process of investigating it.
We removed a [[Gold Plaque]] from the statue.
After leaving town, we entered the forest and got stuck in a pit with vines around our ankles.
