## Story
Continuing on from the events of [[Session 1]], we find ourselves in a stone room with a ceiling made from vines, nothing around us but a wooden door. We went through the door.
The new room is somehow illuminated from above, but the ceiling is just stone. The door we came through is now gone. There is nothing in this room apart from a door on the other side and a single Gold Chest in the centre with the writing "Do not open" on it in red paint.
We opened the door to see only void, after a few tests we learned that anything in the void stays there until we look away. We then opened the chest which caused a tiny naked gnome to pop out, scream at us, punch [[Wurgoth Thundertooth]] in the crotch, then run through the door into the void and vanish.
After a bit more testing, we went through the door to find ourselves in the same room but with two Gold Chests. This time we tried to capture the gnome but failed on the first attempt with the chest on the left.  [[Gauthak Ogolakanu]] managed to shield bash the gnome before it escaped back into the open chest. [[Varis Xiloscient]] decided to do a little experiment by lighting the gnome grease on [[Gauthak Ogolakanu]]'s shield on fire, now there is an outline of the gnome burned into the shield. We then attempted to trap the gnome in the second chest, but the gnome managed to escape through the door into the void.
We then went through the door again, this time it's the same room but with three Gold Chests. This time we go through the door without opening any of the chests. This brings us to the same room, but with only two Gold Chests. We do through the door again without opening any chests and end up in the same room again but with only one Wood Chest. [[Nox]] investigates the chest and gets stuck. [[Varis Xiloscient]] then tries to light the chest on fire but does not manage to do so in time. Turns out the chest is a mimic and a fight between us and the mimic followed. The mimic is now dead. We turned our attention to the door at the end of the room. After the experience with the mimic, we were cautious. After some investigation we determined that the door was also a mimic.
During the fight with the chest mimic, [[Varis Xiloscient]] noticed that a pillar in the room was disguising a spiral stair case.
